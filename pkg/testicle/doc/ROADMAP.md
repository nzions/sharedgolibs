# Testicle: Playwright-Inspired Go Test Runner

## 🎯 Vision Statement

Testicle aims to revolutionize the Go testing experience by bringing the best features of Playwright's test runner to the Go ecosystem. We want to transform `go test` from a simple command-line tool into an interactive, visual, and developer-friendly testing platform that makes testing enjoyable and productive.

## 🚀 Core Philosophy

- **Enhance, Don't Replace**: Build on top of Go's native testing rather than replacing it
- **Visual First**: Provide rich visual feedback and interactive experiences
- **Developer Experience**: Focus on making testing fast, intuitive, and enjoyable
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate status updates and live progress tracking
- **Zero Configuration**: Work out of the box with sensible defaults
